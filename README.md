# Signal Onset and End Detection

This project contains various algorithms to detect the start and end of signals buried in noise.

## Structure

- `src/`: Signal detection algorithms
- `notebooks/`: Demonstration notebooks
- `tests/`: Unit tests
- `data/`: Synthetic/real signals
- `results/`: Output plots and figures

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/signal-onset-end-detection.git
cd signal-onset-end-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
